# Relay transfers

Manage explicit local/remote file transfers with progress, cancellation and integrity checks.

## Status

Development scaffold. This repository currently contains the implementation plan,
not a functional plugin. There is no installable release or remote helper.

[Relay](https://github.com/genomewalker/relay-terminal) currently has an experimental
declarative plugin installer. The scoped broker, permissions and runtime required
for this integration must be implemented and verified before release. This plugin
does not currently perform the operations described above.

## Planned implementation

- [ ] Define scoped upload/download requests and explicit destination review.
- [ ] Stream with bounded memory and cancellation; clean incomplete downloads.
- [ ] Handle collisions, source changes, symlinks and checksum verification.
- [ ] Test large/empty files, Unicode paths, interrupted connections and full disks.

## Installation

Not available yet. Do not install a repository checkout as a plugin or run scripts
from it. Once the required Relay API exists and acceptance checks pass, tagged
GitHub releases will provide the supported package and compatibility information.
No placeholder release is published merely to make the installer show this plugin.

## Safety and release requirements

- Terminal input, rendering, SSH and recovery remain core-owned and independent.
- Access is scoped to the selected project and host; no ambient credentials.
- Activate only when needed. Bound requests, output, memory and background work.
- Test permission denial/revocation, cancellation, disconnects and incompatible workers.
- Publish installation, update, rollback and removal instructions with the first working release.
- Verify the installed UI manually as well as running automated tests.

## Contributing

Open an issue to discuss the protocol and scope before implementing remote helpers.
Keep changes focused and include tests. Do not include credentials, private hostnames,
terminal transcripts or user project data in issues or fixtures.
